# Hotels

When choosing a hotel, picking one close to a bus or a tram stop
(see [transportation](transportation.md)) can be quite handy.

Brussels does have some parts that can be considered unsafe (e.g.
close to the train station Bruxelles-Nord, Schaerbeek). Do your
research on this before picking a hotel.

When booking a hotel, make sure to verify the hotel's rating
through multiple sources, as the ratings on e.g. booking.com and
Google Maps can vary widely.
