# Drinks

At FOSDEM there are several cafeterias that serve soft drinks, water and
several kinds of Belgian beers.

There are usually several coffee stands within the campus, and there are
occasional ones among the food trucks on the street just outside.

Some say bringing our own [water bottle](bottle.md) is a good idea.
