There is no main entry to FOSDEM, there are no tickets, you don't sign up
anywhere, you don't wear a badge (unless you decide you want to).

People are there as inviduals. People normally dress casually and comfortably,
never formally; showing up in a suit or tie certainly would make you stand
out.

There are normally thirty parallel tracks / rooms in which talks are going on.
Each room is managed independently so expect calendar collisions and even
sometimes a ten minute walk to get to the next presentation.

FOSDEM is often crowded. Thousands of similar-minded people with an interest
in Open Source.
