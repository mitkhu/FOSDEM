# Attend talks

See [apps](apps.md) for planning.

Plan ahead. Because there are so many rooms and all talks are planned
independently of each other, chances are you want to attend talks that end up
running at the same time, or just close to each other in time but in rooms
a long walk apart.

The smaller rooms (<= 200 seats) often get full and then you cannot enter. An
old trick has been to enter the room one or two talks *before* the talk you
actually want to see, to increase your chances of getting in.

In some rooms, people get there in the morning and mostly camp around there
for the rest of the day.

## Getting into the room

Make your best to enter and leave rooms *between* the talks. The process of
getting up and leaving is usually noisy and thus it disturbs the entire
audience and the presenter if done mid-presentation.

Always, always use every single seat in the room. Never leave single
unoccupied seats next to you, as that seriously hampers the ability for others
to get into the room to enjoy this special talk!

## If FULL

If the dreaded **FULL** sign hangs on the door, you must not enter. Please
respect the room volunteers that manage the room.

You then have a few different options:

 - Go sit somewhere else and watch the talk live-streamed
 - Find another talk to attend, in another room
 - Chat with your friends, get yourself another drink or line up for fries
 - Go visit some [stands](https://fosdem.org/2026/stands/)
