# How to meet up

FOSDEM is crowded, which makes it quite possible to attend an event for a
weekend and still not run into your friend you know also is there. Unless you
specifically make it happen.

Meeting up with someone at FOSDEM can be a little difficult, partly because
the amount of people present.

When arranging a meeting remember that many of the rooms have several doors,
so "outside the door to..." is not specific enough. Also, some of the
cafeterias are big, so while saying "Chez Theo" is correct, it still takes
quite some walking around and looking.
