# Wifi

The wifi onsite usually works quite well.

The SSID is **FOSDEM**. It is IPv6-only; in 2027 there will be no NAT64.

If you are affiliated with a university, your devices may auto-connect to **[eduroam](https://eduroam.org/)**.
This is run by the ULB and subject to their acceptable use policies. It is also IPv4-only as of 2026.
