# Speaking

## Equipment

The room host should let you know in advance what the requirements are for speaking.

Some sessions will require you to use a shared laptop, others will let you plug in your own equipment.

Assume HDMI 16:9 if nothing else is said.

## Before talk

Some rooms are very crowded and even for a speaker it might take a little time
to get into the room. Prepare for this and be on time!

## Presenting

No one wants to see you fiddling around with resolution settings for 5 minutes. Make sure you have your slides on a USB stick or easily accessible online and be prepared to use the room's laptop.

Some rooms do not have audio from laptops. Check in advance whether you can play sound from your laptop.

Hold the microphone like you are eating an ice-cream. Keep it close to your mouth and speak into it.

Look at the audience, not your slides. No one wants to see the back of your head. Face the audience at all times.

## Post-talk

5 minutes or so before the next talk starts, many people will leave your room
and many others will enter the room. This potentially very loud and noisy
period does not function well for taking questions

The video team sends an email with questions and require confirmation from the
speaker not too soon after the talk ended. We serve the audience better if we
confirm those details sooner rather than later.
