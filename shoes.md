# Shoes

It's good to wear the shoes that work best for a lot of standing and walking
and can handle rain and some puddles (depending on the weather). These might
not be the best looking shoes you have (or they might be) it just needs to be
something that once you put on you won't have to think about until you take
them off, which will probably be hours and hours later.
