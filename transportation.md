# Transportation

- Public transportation can be used very easily: 
    - no need to buy tickets
    - your credit card will just work on the check-in machines, tap it when entering or leaving public transports
- Bus line 71 is the most direct connection between the city center and FOSDEM, but it is also extremely overcrowded during FOSDEM, especially in the mornings and evenings. Consider taking alternative routes, for example:
    - Tram 8 to Louiza, which goes to the edge of the city center and connects to the subway system there
    - Bus 95 stops at a 10 minutes walk from FOSDEM at Cimitière d'Ixelles and goes directly to the city center
    - Subway line 5 stops at a 20 minutes walk at Delta (also reachable by taking bus 71 in the opposite direction) and goes directly to the city center.
    - Tram 25 connects Etterbeek train station or Petillon station (on line 5) to the campus.
    - If arriving by train, Etterbeek station is a twenty minute walk from FOSDEM
    - There are many other options depending on where you're coming from. The STIB/MIVB network map may be useful: https://www.stib-mivb.be/travel/network-and-district-maps
