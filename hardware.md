# What hardware to bring

There is a lack of [power outlets](power.md).

Bring your phone, for arranging adhoc meetings onsite and to keep up with the
schedule and the FOSDEM map.

Bring your laptop if you feel a need to. Lots of people do.

Many rooms get full before you get in and viewing the talks live-streamed on
your device is often a necessary second best alternative.
